IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY
Directory: Your computer puts files and other things in what are called paths 
           so that your computer can have better organization.
           Every folder/file on your computer has a unique path,
           which are know as Directories. If you created a folder
           called test on desktop, the directory would be called:
           C:\Users\<your_user_name>\Desktop\test. In other words,
           directories are how your computer knows where stuff is.
IMPORTANT NOTES
* Spelling errors: Typos can wreck this program. so be very cautious of typos. 

* Complete File path: When asked for a "Complete file path" that means that the
    program is asking for all the information possible about where the file is.
    That is so the program knows exactly where to find/create your file.
    It is the entire sequence of files/ drives that you go through, to get to
    get the desired destination.
    Example for a complete path : C:\Users\<your_user_name>\Desktop\test.
