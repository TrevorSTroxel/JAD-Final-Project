IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY
Directory: Your computer puts files and other things in what are called paths 
           so that your computer can have better organization.
           Every folder on your computer has a unique path,
           which are know as Directories. If you created a folder
           called test on desktop, the directory would be called:
           C:\Users\<your_user_name>\Desktop\test.
